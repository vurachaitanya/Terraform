## Terraform Components

#### Data Sources :
- [Terraform Doc Reff](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/data-sources/index.html)
- [Terraform tutorial Reff](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/data-sources?in=terraform/configuration-language&utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS)
- Data sources allow data to be fetched or computed for use elsewhere in Terraform configuration. Use of data sources allows a Terraform configuration to make use of information defined outside of Terraform, or defined by another separate Terraform configuration.
- The name is used to refer to this resource from elsewhere in the same Terraform module, but has no significance outside of the scope of a module.
- The data source and name together serve as an identifier for a given resource and so must be unique within a module.
